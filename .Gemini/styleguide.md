# Gemini Code Assist Style Guide

## Response Format Rules
- **Actionable Suggestions:** Whenever you recommend a code change, you MUST provide it as a committable GitHub suggestion.
- **Format:** Use the specific GitHub Markdown format for suggestions. Do not just paste a code block; ensure it triggers the "Commit suggestion" UI.
- **Scope:** If a change is too large for a single suggestion block, break it down into smaller, committable chunks.
