    When finding errors or improvements in code:
    1. Do NOT just comment with code blocks.
    2. ALWAYS use the GitHub suggestion syntax for code changes.
    3. Format your response exactly like this:
       ```suggestion
       <corrected_code_here>
       ```
    4. Ensure indentation in the suggestion matches the surrounding code perfectly.
